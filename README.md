# Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating Pi

## Description

This code is a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the value of Pi using random points. The principle behind this simulation is based on the portion of points that fall within a unit circle compared to those inside a square. By generating a large number of random points within a square, this simulation estimates Pi by calculating the ratio of points within the circle to the total number of generated points.
